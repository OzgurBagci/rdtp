2262137 - Ozgur Bagci - Section 1

USAGE

Become root.

Run install.sh script.

For RDTP call '/usr/local/bin/destination' and '/usr/local/bin/source_t' accordingly. Then run "find . -name time.txt"
for output of 100 tests. You need to put input.txt to current working directory before calling the functions.

For SCTP run ./resource/client.o 'IP1:IP2' 'filename' and ./resource/server.o 'IP1:IP2' accordingly without 's. You can
modify source.sctp.sctp.timer module before running 'install.sh' and use it for timing calculations.

ROUTING FILE

Routing file is a JSON Array of objects which have the key of the host. Values of keys are lists of objects that's key
is destination and value is route should be used or the interface should be used. We did not provide a way to modify
routing table but since it is a well-known file, a JSON File, it can be implemented by user according to his/her usage
case.


CONFIGURATION

The method below is followed while creating the configuration of link out of pings (demonstrated for 2 links, may be
used for more than 2 links in implementation):

- To get the most out of multiple links packets divided into these links by the equation "a/b = (y+100)/(x+100)" where
a and b represents the portion of total data divided to Link 1 and Link 2. The y and x represents loss percent of
Link 2 and Link 1. In the case that one of the links' packet loss is 100% only 1 line will be used. This configuration
is applied when the links' latency is the same.

- If latency is different from one link to another formula is further developed into "a/b = n*(y+100)/m*(x+100)" where
the n and m are latency for Link 2 and Link 1. The rest is the same as first formula.

- Timeout carefully calculated and it is found that there exists a function of loss which can be used to calculate best
timeout value. Since it requires lots of computation power the results divided into chunks which are the following in
which mad_max represents maximum value of latency that is derived from ping:
+ loss > 12%        1*mad_max ms
+ 12% >= loss > 6%  2*mad_max ms
+ 6% >= loss > 4%   3*mad_max ms
+ 4% >= loss > 3%   4*mad_max ms
+ 3% >= loss > 2%   5*mad_max ms
+ 2% >= loss > 1%   7*mad_max ms
+ 1% >= loss        9*mad_max ms

- Bulk size is calculated as a function of loss. Bulk size represents sending data in chunks and receiving only one ACK
for the chunk. The formula is the following: "round(10/x^(1/2))" where x represents loss as percent and round represents
mathematical round. Mathematical round rounds the float to upper integer if its decimal part is bigger than or equal
to 5, otherwise rounds to lower integer.

- As a result of calculations it is decided that the window size does not really matter for performance and since it is
16-bit unsigned integer and ACK Window is 8-bit unsigned integer, the Window Size is square of ACK Window Size.
